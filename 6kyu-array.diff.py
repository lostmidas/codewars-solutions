'''
Your goal in this kata is to implement an difference function, which subtracts one list from another.
It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b:
array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:
array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
'''

def array_diff(a, b):
    newArr = [item for item in a if item not in b]
    return newArr
